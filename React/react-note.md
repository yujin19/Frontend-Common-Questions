# React 
### 1. What is react?
 React is component-based library for the frontend view layer.
ReactJS is a component-based javascript library which is used for building an interactive and dynamic user interface for websites and mobile applications specifically for developing single page applications where data reflects in real time.

### 2. What are the features of React?
It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.
It uses server-side rendering.
Server-side rendering (SSR) is a popular technique for rendering a normally client-side only single page app (SPA) on the server and then sending a fully rendered page to the client.
It follows one way data flow or data binding.
One way data flow means that the model is the single source of truth. Changes in the UI trigger messages that signal user intent to the model (or “store” in React). Only the model has the access to change the app’s state. The effect is that data always flows in a single direction, which makes it easier to understand
